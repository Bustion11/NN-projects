# NN-projects

A collection of some neural networks implemented by me. All credits for the architecture belong to the authors of the papers linked to each neural network. The neural networks were trained using resources from the Google Colaboratory paid subsrciption.

## Implemented, trained, and tested:
- [A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/ConvNet)
- [Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/GAN)
- [Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/ITWGAN)
- [Progressive GAN](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/PGAN)
## Implemented, but awaits training:
- [UNet](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/UNet)
- [StyleGAN](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/SGAN)
- [SchNet](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/SchNet)
## Future projects:
- The Original Transformer
- Graph Convolutional Networks
- Graph Attention Networks
