# NN-projects

A collection of some neural networks implemented by me. All credits for the architecture belong to the authors of the papers linked to each neural network. The neural networks were trained using resources from the paid subscription to Google Colaboratory.

## Implemented:
- [A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/ConvNet)

## TODO:
- [ ] Create a toy example for the ConvNet
