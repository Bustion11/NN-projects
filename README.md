# NN-projects

A collection of some neural networks implemented by me. All credits for the architecture belong to the authors of the papers linked to each neural network. The neural networks were trained using resources from the paid subscription to Google Colaboratory.

## Implemented, Trained, and Tested:
- [A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/ConvNet)
- [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/Bustion11/NN-projects/tree/main/GAN)
- [Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs]()

## TODO:
- [ ] Create a toy example for the ConvNet
- [ ] Create a toy exameple for the GAN + clean up the code
